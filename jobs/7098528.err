2024-06-14 12:54:54.063733: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:151] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

You may not need to update to CUDA 11.1; cherry-picking the ptxas binary is often sufficient.
WARNING:tensorflow:Callback method `on_train_batch_end` is slow compared to the batch time (batch time: 0.1193s vs `on_train_batch_end` time: 0.1286s). Check your callbacks.
WARNING:tensorflow:Compiled the loaded model, but the compiled metrics have yet to be built. `model.compile_metrics` will be empty until you train or evaluate the model.
