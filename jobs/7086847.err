2024-06-12 16:15:57.233972: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:151] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 AVX512F FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

2024-06-12 16:35:24.776402: W tensorflow/stream_executor/gpu/asm_compiler.cc:111] *** WARNING *** You are using ptxas 11.0.221, which is older than 11.1. ptxas before 11.1 is known to miscompile XLA code, leading to incorrect results or invalid-address errors.

You may not need to update to CUDA 11.1; cherry-picking the ptxas binary is often sufficient.
